#### 23rd April 2022:
- switched to Go modules
- upgraded dependencies
- switched to Github actions
- added badges to README

#### First commit
- Worked out the bases for the handling of the keys files.
- The keys file will have permission `0400`
- This means only the user who run the golang app will have access to it...and root of course.
- Tests cover 100% of the functions, although they are all grouped in a single method.
